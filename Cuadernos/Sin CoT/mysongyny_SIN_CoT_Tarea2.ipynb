Estas palabras por sí solas refieren a temas de dinero, sueños cumplidos, actividades ilegales pasadas, armas, lealtad, relaciones familiares, y actividades recreativas.\\n\\n[Paso 2: Interpretación y Connotación] La frase parece describir la vida de una persona que ha tenido éxito económico, posiblemente a través de actividades ilegales como el contrabando. Hay una mención al uso de armas y principios de respeto y lealtad, lo cual es común en contextos de grupos organizados. La referencia a Guadalajara y su cartel sugiere una conexión con actividades ilícitas en esta región geográfica. Sin embargo, el enfoque general de la letra parece ser la celebración de logros personales y respeto ganado, más que la promoción directa de violencia o odio.\\n\\n[Paso 3: Evaluación contra S (Sexualization)] La frase no contiene insinuaciones, lenguaje o descripciones de naturaleza sexual. No hay referencias a actos sexuales, deseo, o atracción. Por lo tanto, no hay elementos de sexualización presentes.\\n\\n[Paso 4: Evaluación contra V (Violence)] Aunque hay menciones de armas y situaciones que podrían implicar violencia (como \"armas largas\" y \"se puso en acción\"), la frase no describe actos violentos específicos. No hay amenazas directas ni escenas de agresión física. Las armas se mencionan como parte de la vida del narrador, pero no se detalla el uso de estas para infligir daño.\\n\\n[Paso 5: Evaluación contra H (Hate)] La frase no contiene expresiones de hostilidad, discriminación o desprecio hacia individuos o grupos. No hay lenguaje de odio ni se identifica a ningún grupo como objetivo de desprecio.\\n\\n[Paso 6: Síntesis y Justificación Final] La frase carece de elementos de sexualización, violencia explícita, o odio. Aunque se mencionan armas y actividades ilegales, estas no se acompañan de una narrativa que incite o promueva el odio o la violencia. El enfoque parece más bien ser una descripción de estilo de vida y logros personales que no incitan a actos sexuales, violentos o de odio. Esto justifica la categoría \\'NR\\', ya que no se presentan elementos de S, V, o H en el análisis.',\n"," 'label': 1,\n"," 'labelconletras': 'NR',\n"," 'text': 'Analiza la siguiente letra de
